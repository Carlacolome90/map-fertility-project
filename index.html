    <p>Surrogacy in the United States is a reproductive method used by some families. In recent times the number of fertility clinics has increased, in a country where <a href="https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/surrogacy-market"> 10% of women between the ages of 15 and 49 </a> have difficulty getting pregnant.
    </p>


    <p>As the map below shows, New York is one of the states with the most assisted reproductive technology (ART) procedure clinics, and the state with the highest number of embryo transfers in 2020, according to the latest <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/art/reports/archive.html"> CDC data</a>.

  <p>Attorney Gina-Marie Madow, of surrogacy agency ConceiveAbilities, says this is because New York is one of the safest states for women to undergo these procedures.
  </p>

  <p>"New York enacted the Gestational Surrogate Mothers' Rights Act to ensure that mothers know their rights to health and welfare, right to counsel, insurance and medical expenses, and protection in the event of termination. This is not the case in other states," she said.
